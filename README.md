# Vojta's Bachelor project

This repository contains the code that I have used for data analysis in my Bachelor thesis at Amsterdam University College. The code uses Python 3 and
requires the following packages to be installed:

+ `h5py`
+ `matplotlib`
+ `numpy`
+ `pandas`
+ `pybind11`
+ `scikit-learn`
+ `scipy`

Additionally, in my analysis, I have used a custom Python package for a greedy search for the best Minimally Complex Model (MCM), 
available at [1](https://github.com/DM-Lab-UvA/MinCompSpin_Python/tree/Reorganisation). Note that I have used the
"Reorganisation" branch of the MinCompSpin_Python repository, and I my code assumes that the folder with this repository is renamed
to "MinCompSpin_Python" and placed in the same folder as the rest of my code when it is run. In my project, I have analyzed data 
obtained by [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30600-4). All of their data is available at 
[3](https://gitlab.com/csnlab/olcese-lab/modid-project/2nd-bump/-/commits/master/?ref_type=HEADS).
